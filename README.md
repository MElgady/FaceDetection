# Face Detection

Project name: Face Detection

Description: This code provides the basics of the OpenCV library and uses them to: Detect faces that enter the camera, write the time a face is detected and the time a face leaves into a .csv file and the file is saved in the main directory of wherever the python file is saved.

Installation: Download the capturing_time.py and open in your code editor. Then run the app and new windows will open with camera frames that have different filters on them.

Usage: Once an object has entered the frame, a square will appear around the object. Press 'q' to quit the program and then check the times.csv file. The time an object entered (Start) and exited the frame (End) will be displayed.

Credits: Based on code written by Ardit Sulce from the Python Mega Course on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/
